Horse Colic Dataset - Data Collection and Preparation
Overview
This repository contains code and instructions for handling the Horse Colic dataset. The dataset comprises medical characteristics of horses affected by colic, focusing on predicting whether the issue was surgical or not.

Files Included
horse-colic.txt: Raw dataset file obtained from ePortal.
horsecolic.names: Description file detailing the dataset's columns and attributes.
horse-colic.csv: Converted dataset file in CSV format.
horse-colic-with-NaN.csv: Updated dataset with missing values represented as NaN.
horse-colic-with-title.csv: Dataset with updated headers as per the description file.
README.md: Instructions and overview of the repository.
Tasks Accomplished
Converting Raw Data

Demonstrated multiple ways to convert horse-colic.txt to horse-colic.csv.
Verified the integrity of the CSV data in Jupyter Notebook.
Handling Missing Values

Replaced missing values ("?") with NaN in the loaded dataset using Python.
Saved the updated dataset as horse-colic-with-NaN.csv.
Header Renaming

Renamed headers based on the description file, limiting titles to no more than 10 characters.
Saved the modified dataset as horse-colic-with-title.csv.
Data Analysis

Loaded horse-colic-with-title.csv and displayed the total NaN values per column.
Visualized the NaN counts per column using a blue-colored bar chart via Matplotlib.
Data Types and Handling NaN

Retrieved the datatypes for each column in the dataset.
Considered the impact of dropping NaN rows in the dataset.
Code Evaluation

Assessed and justified the method used in a code snippet to reduce missing values.
Code Annotation

Provided inline comments in the code file (Figure 1) to explain missing sections and steps.
Conclusion
The tasks performed include data conversion, handling missing values, data visualization, and code evaluation. The dataset is now prepared for further analysis and machine learning tasks.
